This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.




#Arithmetic operations
```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 2

x+y
x-y
x*y
x/y
x%%y
x^y
x%/%y

```

#Relational Operations
```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 2

x<y
x>y
x==y
x>=y
x<=y
x!=y
```

#Logical Operations
```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 0, "hi") # - the whole vector is treated as vector of character
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 0, 6)
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

x
y
x&y #Element-wise logical And
x&&y #Logical And for the first element
x|y #Element-wise Logical OR
x||y #First element Logical OR
```

Vector Assignment and Coercion
```{r}
x <- c(0,1,2,3,4)
typeof(x)
```
```{r}
x <- c(0,1.2,3,5.7)
typeof(x)
```
```{r}
x <- c(0,1,3,TRUE,"hello")
typeof(x)
```

Using seq() function to create a vector
```{r}
seq(1,5,by=0.2)
```
```{r}
seq(1,5,length.out = 4)
```

Accessing Elements in Vector
```{r}
x <- seq(1,5, by=0.5)
x[1]
x[1.5]
x[c(1,4)]
x[-1]
x[1,4] #multiple indices should be used using vector notation
x[c(4,-1)] #throws an error- cannot mix positive and negative indices

```
Logical access and modification

```{r}
x[x<3] <- 2
x
```

Character access
```{r}
x <- c("first"=1, "second"=2, "third"=3)
x["first"]
x[c("first","second")]
```

sorting the vector
```{r}
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```

```{r}
x <- c("first"=1, "second"=2, "third"=3, NA )
sum(x, na.rm = TRUE) #removes NA values to calculate sum
x
```

Lists
```{r}
nlst <- list(one = 1, two = c("Hello","World"),many = c(3, 4, 5))
nlst
x <- list("a" = 2.5, "b" = TRUE, "c" = 1:3)
str(x)
length(x)

x[c(1:2)]    # index using integer vector 
x[-2]        # using negative integer to exclude second component
x[c(T,F,F)]  # index using logical vector
x[c("a","c")]

typeof(x["a"])

x[["c"]]
x$c
x$c[3]
```


Matrices and Operations
```{r}
y= matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
y
y[c(1,2),c(2,3)] # selecting a section of matrix rows and columns
z =  matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
z
z[c(3,2),]    # leaving column field blank will select entire columns

z[,]    # leaving row as well as column field blank will select entire matrix

z[-1,]    # select all rows except first

z[z<5] <- 0; z #assigning based on condition and adding a statement in the same line by using ; as separator
```

```{r}
x2 <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c("X","Y","Z"), c("A","B","C"))) #name the rows and columns of matrix
x2
colnames(x2)
rownames(x2)
cbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6)) #another way of creating matrix column bind
rbind(c(1,2,3),c(4,5,6))  #another way of creating matrix row bind

```
Transpose of a matrix
```{r}
t(x2)
dim(x2)

dim(x2) <- c(9,1); x2
```

DataFrames
```{r}
x4 <- data.frame("SN" = 1:2, "Age" = c(21,15), "Name" = c("John","Dora"))
x4
typeof(x4$Name)

x3 <- data.frame("SN" = 1:2, "Age" = c(21,15), "Name" = c("John", "Dora"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
x3
typeof(x3$Name)

names(x3)
str(x3)

ncol(x3)

nrow(x3)

head(x3, n=1)
head(x3) #Generally returns top 6
```

```{r}
x3[x3$Age > 16,3]
x3[x3$Age > 16,]
```

```{r}
x3 <- x3[order(x3$Age, decreasing = FALSE),]
x3
```
